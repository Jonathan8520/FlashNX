### 0001-mario63-zero-scale-hit-test.patch

**Fix Phase 2.4.a — missing Toad castle (issue #6906).**

Adds a zero-determinant matrix guard in `hit_test_bounds` and
`hit_test_shape` of `core/src/display_object.rs`. Without this patch, Mario 63
treats a zero-scale placeholder MC of the castle as "hittable", which
breaks the logic chain: Toad NPC not instantiated, Mario floating in
the void, progression blocked.

To be submitted as an upstream PR to revive and close #6906 for good.
The patch is also useful to any other Ruffle frontend (Web, desktop) — the
Adobe Flash Player parity is correct.

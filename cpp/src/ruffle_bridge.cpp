#include "ruffle_bridge.h"

// Bridge between C++ frontend and the Rust staticlib.
// The Rust side exports ruffle_init / ruffle_render_frame / ruffle_shutdown
// with #[no_mangle] extern "C" linkage; the linker resolves them when
// libruffle_switch.a is pulled in.
//
// This translation unit exists so future bridge state (callbacks, opaque
// handles, error formatting) lives in one place.
